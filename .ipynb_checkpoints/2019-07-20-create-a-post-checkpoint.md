To create a post in ARES, you need to have access to [the private site](https://eafit.sharepoint.com/sites/ARES). If you already have access, you need to follow these steps:

1. Go to [Documents](https://eafit.sharepoint.com/sites/ARES/Documentos compartidos/).
2. Enter to the blog folder.
3. Create a folder with your username, this will be **your folder**. 
4. Copy inside **your folder** this file `2019-07-20-create-a-post.md`.
5. Edit your copy. 

The file name should have a formated name `YYYY-MM-DD-name.md` where `YYYY` stands for Year, `MM` for month and `DD` for day. Without this format on the file, the page won't be processed. 

- The blog will be updated every week day at $9 AM$.
- The posts are written in **Markdown**.
- An excellent Markdown Editor is [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/try), it can be runned online.
